        + `\n`
        + `1. Be Nice!\n\n`
        + `2. Please respect the topics for each channel.\n\n`
        + `3. **No NSFW** / sexually explicit content or language :child:, a warning maybe posted to your account. This depends on the severity of the message/image \n\n`
        + `4. **Don't** spam several channels with the same post. For example, if you a promoting an event, post it in one relevant channel. This will have you get a warning from one of the staff members or owner. \n\n`
        + `5. **Donâ€™t** spam. This goes for **all** of the discord channels and Twitch chat. \n\n`
        + `6. Be respectful to everyone!!!!! \n\n`
        + `7. No self promotions in the server, **the only exception** is in the <#793991572672217089> channel. This rule also applies for the Twitch chat. \n\n`
        + `8. Follow the Discord and Twitch official rules! The T.O.S of both services can be found here: \n\n`
        + `**Discord T.O.S:** (https://discord.com/terms) \n`

        + `10. **Don't** ask the staff or owner to change your role. If the staff or the owner feels the need to do so, they will. Spamming a staff member **(through DM's or server chat's )** for a role will get you a warning. \n\n`
